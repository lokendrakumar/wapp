      <p></p><b style="font-size:18px">PRIVACY POLICY</b><p></p>Date of Last Revision: July 11, 2014<br><br>Pochi International Mobile Pte Ltd. (“Pochi”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Pochi websites, including the websites located at frankly.me, the Pochi service, and any Pochi software applications made available by Pochi, including the mobile device applications frankly.me (together, the "Services”). Pochi created this Privacy Policy to give you or your company (in either case, “You” or “Your”) confidence as You visit and use the Services, and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services and not to any websites of third parties (“Third-Party Websites”), which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CEASE USING OR ACCESSING THE SERVICES. Each time You access the Services, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time You use the Services, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last time You used the Services. For additional information, see the section concerning Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy, below.<br><br><b>1. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</b><br>Pochi does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Pochi obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Pochi will immediately delete such information from its database. Because Pochi does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, Pochi has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Pochi has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).<br><br><b>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</b><br><b>(a) Traffic Data.</b><br>Like most website and mobile application operators, Pochi automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Services; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Services (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.<br><br><b>(b) Cookie Policy</b><br>Our Services may use "cookies" to enhance your User experience. Your web browser places cookies on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about you. You may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, note that some parts of the Services may not function properly.<br>Pochi uses first-party cookies on the Services, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, and Flurry Analytics Cookie for the following purposes: to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing your experience on the Services to your interests; and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Services. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE FIRST-PARTY COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER OR ELECTRONIC DEVICE SETTINGS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SERVICES, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SERVICES MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.
